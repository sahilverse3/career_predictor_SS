Career Compass: A Student Career Predictor
Project Overview
Career Compass is a simple, yet insightful, web-based application designed to help students in grades 10-12 explore potential career paths. By answering a series of targeted questions about their interests, strengths, and academic preferences, students receive a personalized career recommendation. This project serves as an excellent starting point for those new to web development, demonstrating a complete, single-file application with a clean, modern user interface.

Key Features
Interactive Questionnaire: Guides students through a series of questions with simple, multiple-choice options.

Dynamic Content: The questions and results are generated dynamically using JavaScript, providing a smooth user experience.

Personalized Recommendations: Based on the user's answers, the application calculates a "score" and maps it to a suitable career domain (e.g., STEM, Creativity, Business).

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the application is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Single-File Solution: The entire application—HTML structure, styling, and JavaScript logic—is contained within a single index.html file, making it incredibly easy to deploy and share.

How It Works
The application uses a basic scoring mechanism. Each answer option is assigned a value that corresponds to a specific career domain (e.g., 'STEM', 'Creativity'). As the user progresses through the questions, their answers are tallied. At the end, the domain with the highest score is presented as the recommended career path, along with a brief description of the field.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the foundational structure of the web page.

CSS (with Tailwind CSS): For all styling, ensuring a sleek and responsive design without the need for an external stylesheet.

JavaScript: For all the core logic, including handling user input, managing the questionnaire flow, and calculating results.

Getting Started
To run this project, simply download the index.html file and open it in any modern web browser. No special server or setup is required!
